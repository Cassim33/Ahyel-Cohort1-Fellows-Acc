AHYEL Cohort-1 Dashboard
This is a simple, modern web application for the AHYEL Cohort-1 Fellows, providing a dashboard with various sections like announcements, profile, resources, and more. The application uses a clean, responsive design with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Responsive Design: Looks great on both mobile and desktop devices.

Single-Page Application (SPA) feel: Navigates between sections without full page reloads.

Simple Login System: A dummy login is implemented for demonstration purposes.

Modular Code: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are separated into individual files for better organization and maintainability.

Technology Stack
HTML: Provides the structure of the web pages.

CSS: Handles all the styling and layout, including a gradient background and a glassmorphism effect for the card.

JavaScript: Manages the application's logic, including login authentication, navigation between pages, and dynamic content updates.
